# EE677 Assignment1: Netlist Simulation Assignment

This assignment focuses on simulating a Verilog netlist generated by [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/) using a CMOS cell library. The supported gates include:

- BUF
- NOT
- NAND
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- NOR
- DFF
- DFFSR

The netlist is parsed to map gates and wires, storing the wire information in a dictionary (`wires_map`).
Sequential simulation is done by using DFF and DFFSR gates, where states are stored and reused in subsequent runs.

### Running Instructions

To run the simulation, execute the following:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

In main.py, update the file path as necessary. The default is:

```python3
file_path = "./test/dff_c.v"  # Modify this line for a different input file.
```

Each gateâ€™s output is calculated based on its logic type (e.g., AND, OR, DFF, etc.), and the DFF/DFFSR state is updated and reused across simulation runs.
